# Running as a Service

 * Update ``scratch_n_sniff`` to include the path you have it installed in, and the filter / destination info you need.
 * Copy the file to `/usr/bin/` and add the executable permission (``chmod +x /usr/bin/scratch_n_sniff``)
 * Check you can start the service and it runs / functions OK with ``scratch_n_sniff start``
